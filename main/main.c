/*
An example showing the ESP32 as a
WebSocket server.

Demonstrates:
the ESP32 as a WiFi Access Point,
embedding files (html, js, etc.) for a server,
WebSockets,
LED control.

All example options are in "Example Options"

All WebSocket Server options are in:
Component config ---> WebSocket Server

Connect an LED to pin 2 (default)
Connect to the Access Point,
default name: "ESP32 Test"
password: "hello world"

go to 192.168.4.1 in a browser

Note that there are two regular server tasks.
The first gets incoming clients, then passes them
to a queue for the second task to actually handle.
I found that connections were dropped much less frequently
this way, especially when handling large requests. It
does use more RAM though.
